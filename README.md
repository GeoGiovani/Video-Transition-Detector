### Description
For this project, we were interested in characterizing video transitions, such
as cuts and wipes. To do this, we set out to create a "Spatio-Temporal" Image
(STI) with video content for each frame on the y-axis vs time on the x-axis. To
see this app in action, follow the application link below and upload a .mp4 
video having a transition. Next, select the video, choose an STI generation 
method, and click the "Generate STI" button. This app was created in the class 
CMPT 365 - Multimedia Systems.

### Application Link:

Note: The app is running on a free hosting platform, and as a result, 
responses can be delayed. Please allow 5-10 seconds between uploading a video 
and attempting to generate an STI.
